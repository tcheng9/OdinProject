Improvements:
1. Finish the html color
2. Remove all colors

Notes:
"-" will need to be "\-" in regex because it is a reserved symbol

Gotchas I didn't deal with:
1. Can I string multiople functions together?
2. Round answers with long deciamls
3. Dealing with "=" before enough numbers are there
4. Divide by 0 error handling

Extra credit:
1.Add decimal functionality
2. Make it look nice
3. Backspace button -> Easy to do, just do -1 from the stringHolder var
4. Add keyboard support
